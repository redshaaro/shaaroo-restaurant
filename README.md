#  Restaurant online ordering application
This is a self-training project to apply my skills in next13 using its powerful features to develop a high quality fullstack project.
Briefly this is an online ordering application that allows you to make an order from different menus from various kitchens through a userfriendly and a nice looking interface. It also allows the user to monitor his order status throuh a user-dashboard and some other details about the order, the whole order process is very simple and secure. 
The application also contains a dashboard for the restaurant manager to add, delete or edit the products in the menus, additionlly there is an orders dashboard but personallized for ordering managment so the responsible person can update the status of the order.The application is sill under-development and this is the first release wait for more managment features such as supply chain management, customer loyalty programs and more and more 

I hope you enjoy it!!!
